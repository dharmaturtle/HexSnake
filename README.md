# HexSnake

Decided to learn more about C and hexagon geometry, and so wrote a simple "snake" game in C, but with hexagons. Turns out hexagons are pretty complicated.

## How to use

Compile the .c or run the .exe

Use the numpad to control.

`7` `8` `9` go upper left, up, and upper right
`4` `5` `6` go lower left, down, and lower right

## To do

Still some features I want to implement, like user defined grid size and speed, as well as more control options and to get rid of the flickering from `cls`. But the game works, and its very playable!
